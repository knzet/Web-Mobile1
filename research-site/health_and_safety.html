            <h2>Health and Safety in HVAC Systems</h2>
            <p>Hospitals use specially designed HVAC systems to keep workers and patients safe from infection. The same
                principles are also applicable to other contamination-sensitive environments (clean rooms for silicon
                manufacturing, recycled-air systems like a submarine). Here, we will only cover hospital systems: those
                in the operating room, and in the airborne infection isolation room.
            </p>
            <p>The OR system is simple. Positive pressure is used to prevent infectious particles from entering the
                room. This means that the air system is set up to push air into the room, through HEPA filters. Air in
                this system enters the room without harmful contaminants, then leaves the room, where there are
                contaminants. Ideally, no air re-enters the room without coming through the HEPA filter.
            </p>
            <p>Operating rooms are designed to protect the patient from infection. What if the patient is infectious?
                Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms were developed to protect the nurses and doctors from the patientâ€™s
                infection. They use the opposite mode: negative air pressure. This means that all air entering the room
                comes from clean sources like before, but is pulled out faster than it comes in, allowing viral droplets
                and other infectious particles to leave quickly without being breathed in. Below are some criteria for
                implementing AIIR, specifically for COVID-19 patients (Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation).
            </p>
            <h3>AIIR (Airborne Infection Isolation Room) Criteria</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>At least 12 air exchanges per hour</li>
                <li>Inability to inadvertently change the ventilation modes from a negative mode to a positive mode</li>
                <li>Tightly sealed doors</li>
                <li>Self-closing doors</li>
                <li>A permanent indicator of airflow that is visible when the room is occupied</li>
                <li>A filtration system with at least 90% efficiency</li>
            </ul>
