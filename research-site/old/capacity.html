            <h2>HVAC Capacity Considerations</h2>
            <p>Cooling capacity and total airflow requirements must be factored into a design. Capacity needs to be
                known early in the process, baked into the building design. It is harder and can be more expensive to
                retrofit central air into a building after the fact.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some passive options exist for high capacity systems. Drop ceilings reduce HVAC load by artificially
                reducing the height of the ceiling, reducing the volume of air moving around the room or building.
                Insulation on outer building walls helps hold a temperature gradient for housing, but is more important
                for larger buildings where there might be temperature gradients between rooms, like walk-in freezers in
                restaurants.
