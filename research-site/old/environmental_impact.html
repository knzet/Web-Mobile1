            <h2>Environmental Impact of HVAC Systems</h2>
            <p>Traditional refrigerant chemicals, including the infamous CFCs, are harmful to the ozone layer and other
                natural systems on our planet. They are also hazardous and potentially deadly if inhaled or ingested
                (Elsevier). Luckily, refrigerant systems are closed-loop, meaning that the fluid travelling through the
                system reaches the end and is back at the beginning, without escaping into the air. Unfortunately, leaks
                are common. Many consumers ‘fix’ slowly leaking AC systems by filling them with more coolant as the
                level drops. This is wasteful, and potentially dangerous. A leaking refrigerant pipe needs to be
                repaired or replaced, because all the fluid being added at pressure will inevitably leak out into the
                air. New coolants are incrementally developed to fix some of the environmental downsides, but they just
                introduce new, slightly different environmental downsides that haven’t yet led to their banning.</p>

            <p>The same environmental and health concerns apply to coal- and gas- burning heat systems. The materials
                themselves may not seem environmentally harmful, but the byproducts of burning them are.</p>

            <p>This seems like a dire situation considering how common heating and cooling systems are in homes and
                commercial use, but continue on to the Alternatives to Traditional HVAC Systems page to learn what is
                changing.
