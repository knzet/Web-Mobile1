            <h2>Mobile HVAC Considerations</h2>
            <p>What mobile applications are there for HVAC?</p>
            <p>Cars, refrigerated shipping containers, and underground public transit</p>

            <h3>Mobile Considerations</h3>
            <p>A mobile AC system designer must think about durability from vibration, which is worse in mobile systems
                than permanent ones. Vibration can cause excess wear and shorten device life if not accounted for.
                Particularly in the case of cars, power supply is a consideration. Car batteries have a low capacity for
                continuous current draw. Because of this, the fan and compressor systems in cars draw their power from
                the engine’s output. Since the engine is designed to spin, and motors in traditional air compressors
                spin, there is no need for an electric motor to compress the refrigerant. This results in higher
                efficiency and a simpler system with fewer components to fail.
            </p>
            <p>A downside to mobile designs is that they are custom to the car. Window units, for example, are designed
                once and mass produced easily. Each new car needs a new AC design process, which is wasteful because the
                same designs would ideally be re-used and improved on.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are passive alternatives to the HVAC system in cars. At low speeds, opening the windows uses the
                motion of the car to force fresh air through the cabin. Partially open windows in combination with the
                greenhouse effect from the sun can regulate the interior temperature to the desired one. Open windows
                hurt fuel efficiency at highway speeds because they create drag. Temperature-controlled trucks and
                shipping containers use insulation to keep their cargo cool, since they can’t open windows.
            </p>
            <p>
                A more high-tech approach to mobile passive cooling was patented by the US government. They describe
                sealed coolant pipes directing heat away from sensitive instrument panels in a car’s dashboard. The
                design uses similar heat transfer ideas to traditional cooling, but without any need for pumps, allowing
                it to work when the car is off. Another claimed benefit is that the passive system reduces the load on
                the car’s AC. It wouldn’t replace, but cooperate with, traditional car AC (National Renewable Energy).
