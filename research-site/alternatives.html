            <h2>Alternatives to Traditional HVAC Systems</h2>
            <p>Some of the information presented on this site included downsides to traditional heating, cooling, and
                ventilation systems, from environmental impacts, to design limitations, to health hazards. What are our
                other options?
            </p>

            <p>Some researchers found that modifications needed to be made to existing ventilation systems during the
                COVID pandemic. Their airflow analysis showed that additional fans at strategic areas in a room,
                combined with other techniques, decreased the spread of droplets that might carry pathogens (Cheong,
                Chang Heon, et al.). This could be taken into consideration when designing new ventilation systems, even
                for other diseases like the flu.
            </p>

            <p>One increasingly common replacement for some heat and AC systems is called a heat pump. Heat pumps, if
                installed appropriately, are more energy efficient than traditional systems, and more flexible. They can
                perform heating and cooling combined into one unit, and can use geothermal heat as a source. Some
                dual-compressor systems increase efficiency further by operating at a slower motor speed when the
                heating load is less, rather than kicking on and off at full power in cycles like most other units
                (Energy.Gov). Check out this youtube video by Technology Connections explaining heat pumps. </p>

            <p>New high tech cooling systems in industrial applications use helium gas as the refrigerant, replacing
                chemicals like HFCs. This youtuber explains how thermoacoustic heat pumps work by counterintuitively
                putting sound energy into the system: </p>

            <p>Some lab experiments with this technology have achieved a cooling potential of 134.34 Watts, resulting in
                an electrical-to-thermal <span>efficiency of 113.43%!</span> (Kamil, Mohanad Q., et al.) If this
                efficiency is
                developed into industry, or even home applications, the energy savings would reduce the load on the
                power grid. Unfortunately, this cooling tech might not make it to mass market, home use, as it is
                specialized.
            </p>

            <p>While home cooling is less exciting than lab technology, it is more important when it comes to phasing
                out old systems for those that are better for the environment. What if your home heating and cooling
                could be accomplished at least partially passively? The US Government published <a
                    href='https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/passive-solar-homes'>this guide</a> to understanding
                passive home design that takes advantage of the sun. </p>

            <p>It starts before construction, when planning where on the lot to place the building. Since we are in the
                northern hemisphere, the sun appears in the south in the sky. Therefore, placing the dwelling on the
                north side of the property allows the southern view to be unobstructed by surrounding buildings or
                trees. Briefly, the strategies described on the page include intentional paint color selection,
                conduction systems that allow air to flow and distribute heat, and strategic use of shade and insulation
                to protect against heat in the summer (“Passive Solar Homes.” Energy.Gov). Passive building design
                reduces the reliance on heating and air conditioning, lowering bills for the homeowner, and reducing the
                use of gas-burning heat or power-hungry AC.</p>
